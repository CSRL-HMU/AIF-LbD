This package implements an active perception controller for minimizing the uncertainty during visual observations of an action performed by a human hand. 

A UR5e robot is considered with a ZED 2 camera attached to its end-effector.



## 1. Usage

For running the active perception controller:

```
python3 AIF_main.py

```
